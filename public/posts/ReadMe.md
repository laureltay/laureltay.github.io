Hello! Welcome to my blog ! A space I hope to use to reflect on both the mountaintop moments as well as the uneasy ones. A lil place to hold real life beyond the highlight reels and carefully curated social media posts. I’d like to think that much of life and grace begins in the difficult conversations (both with others and myself). So read on to follow a twenty- something trying to navigate this world, writing things down as I go...
