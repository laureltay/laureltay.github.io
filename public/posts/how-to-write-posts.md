Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes it easy to write formatted content. Here's a quick guide to the most common markdown syntax.

## Headings

Use `#` symbols to create headings:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

## Text Formatting

- **Bold text** with `**bold**` or `__bold__`
- *Italic text* with `*italic*` or `_italic_`
- `Inline code` with backticks

## Lists

Unordered lists:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Ordered lists:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links and Images

Create links with `[link text](URL)`:

## Code Blocks

Use triple backticks for code blocks:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## Quotes

Use `>` for blockquotes:

> This is a quote. It can span multiple lines and will be styled differently from regular text.

## That's It!

These basics will cover most of your blogging needs. Happy writing!
