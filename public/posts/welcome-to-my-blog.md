Welcome to my new blog! This is a simple, clean blog built with React and GitHub Pages.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a simple way to share my thoughts, projects, and learnings without the overhead of a complex CMS or platform. React and GitHub Pages provide the perfect combination of simplicity and power.

## Features

- **Markdown Support**: All posts are written in simple markdown
- **Clean Design**: Inspired by modern, minimalist design principles
- **Fast & Secure**: Static site generation means no databases or server-side code
- **Free Hosting**: GitHub Pages hosts it all for free

## Getting Started

To write a new post, I just create a new markdown file in the `public/posts` directory and add the metadata to `src/posts.js`.

Each post needs metadata in the posts array:

```javascript
{
  slug: 'your-post-slug',
  title: 'Your Post Title',
  date: '2025-01-05',
  category: 'Your Category',
  excerpt: 'A short description of your post'
}
```

Then I can write the rest of the post in markdown!

## What's Next

I'm excited to share more content here. Stay tuned for posts about:

- Web development
- Programming tips and tricks
- Personal projects
- And more!

Thanks for reading!
