I've been thinking a lot about the idea of *beginning again*.

There's something subtly powerful about remembering you get to start over after messing up... not just once but as many times as you like. I used to be incredibly fixated on wasted time, often replaying things I should've done better and moments I wish I could redo. This includes really big mistakes as well as the tiny ones that don't matter at all in retrospect. I remember when I was younger these mistakes used to feel so permanent, like something I'd have to carry with me forever... accompanied by the suffocating weight of regret. But somewhere along the way I realised, when you're already feeling so crappy, beginning again isn't just the optimistic route, it's the most practical and probably the kindest thing you can do for yourself. 

There's a psychology concept called *learned helplessness* which occurs when repeated failures teach you to stop trying altogether. I'd like to think it's the opposite of what people like to call *grit*, a concept I've been thinking about a lot lately as well. I think maybe, grit is the willingness to begin over and over again even after messing up.

I saw a quote trending reels recently that goes "when someone knows your heart, they don't reduce you to one moment", it made me think about how often I do that to myself... take one moment and completely narrow myself down to it. 

Maybe at the core of it, *beginning again* is about refusing to define yourself by a single moment, or even many moments altogether. It's a tricky concept for me to grasp, because aren't we all to a certain extent defined by the sum of our actions and behaviours? 

Of course I don't think that *beginning again* is about pretending those moments and mistakes didn't happen, I think it's about taking responsbility for them while realising they don't necessarily confine us. There's a difference between being shaped by something and being reduced to it, I think. 

I admit I'm not great at holding both accountability and grace in these moments, especially the harder ones. But I guess I'm learning, each day that I get to begin again.


Regret + sunk cost -> believing a past moment 'locks' you in

Learned helplessness -> believing failure predicts the future
