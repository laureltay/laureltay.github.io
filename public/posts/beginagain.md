I've been thinking a lot about the idea of *beginning again*.

There's something subtly powerful about remembering you get to start over, not just once or twice, but as many times as you like. I used to be incredibly fixated on wasted time, often replaying things I should've done better and moments I wish I could redo. Mistakes that were really big but also the tiny ones that don't matter at all in retrospect. When I was younger, those mistakes felt permanent like a sentence I'd have to carry with me forever... accompanied by the suffocating weight of regret. I used to also really dislike when people tried to comfort me by saying things like "look on the bright side" or "it's all about growth", it felt oddly dismissive. But somewhere along the way I realised, when you're already at the bottom with nowhere to go, beginning again isn't just the optimistic route, it's the most practical and probably the kindest thing you can do for yourself. 

There's a psychology concept called *learned helplessness* which occurs when repeated failures teach you to stop trying altogether. I'd like to think it's the opposite of what people like to call *grit*, a concept I've been thinking about a lot lately as well. I think maybe, grit is the willingness to begin over and over again even after messing up.

I saw a quote trending reels recently that goes "when someone knows your heart, they don't reduce you to one moment", it made me think about how often I do that to myself... take one moment and completely narrow myself down to it. 

Maybe at the core of it, *beginning again* is about refusing to define yourself by a single moment, or even many moments altogether. It's a tricky concept for me to grasp, because aren't we all to a certain extent defined by the sum of our actions and behaviours? 

Of course I don't think that *beginning again* is about pretending those moments and mistakes didn't happen, I think it's about taking responsbility for them while realising they don't necessarily confine us. There's a difference between being shaped by something and being reduced to it, I think. 

I admit I'm not great at holding both accountability and grace in these moments, especially the harder ones. But I guess I'm learning, each day that I get to begin again.


Regret + sunk cost -> believing a past moment 'locks' you in

Learned helplessness -> believing failure predicts the future
